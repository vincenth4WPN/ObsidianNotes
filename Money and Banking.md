# Money and Banking
## Nature of Money
1. Medium of Exchange
2. Store of value
3. Unit of Account - Everything can be compared to monetary value

### History of Money
1. Metallic - Sovereigns debase money $\rightarrow$ [[Gresham's Law]]
2. Paper
3. Fractionally backed paper money - Based on credibility of issuing institutions (Slight weight of gold)
4. Fiat money - Only backed by government (no weight of gold)

Bank Runs - Large amount people wanting to pull cash out of banks

## Canadian Banking System
Bank of Canada acts as bank for other banks

### Commercial Banks 
Private owned profit seeking institutions
	- Make profit by charging higher interest rate on loans than interest rate they pay on their deposits
	- Reserves: funds in cash or deposit to BOC to transfer to clear interbank liabilities

Risk-return trade: smaller reserve, more loans and interest but may run short. If bank run happens = bad

Res. Ratio: $v = \frac{\text{Reserves}}{\text{Deposits}}$

$$\Delta\text{Deposits} = \frac{1}{v}\Delta v\text{reserves}$$

Assuming Ideal Res. Ratio = 20%
Banks will constantly loan out deposits to get 20% reserve ratio

#### Excess reserves and cash drawins
- Cash drain occurs whenever anyone wants to old some of their income in cash
- c is ratio of money drained out from banking into cash

$$\Delta\text{deposits} = \frac{\Delta\text{reserves}}{v + c}$$
## Money Supply
Money supply = Currency + Deposits

- Kinds of Deposits
	- money that did not earn interest
	- Other assets that earn interest

### Definitions of Money Supply
Common Definition:
	-M2 = currency + chequable and non chequable  deposits held at chartered banks
Broader:
	-M2+ = M2 + similar deposits at non-chartered banks

- Near Money
	- Assets readily convertible to liquid
- Substitutes
	- Credit cards
	- Can be used to exchange but dont count as actually paying
