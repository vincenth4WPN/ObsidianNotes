# Money, Interests Rates, Economic Activity
Bonds
	- Maturity value: how much it is worth at mature
	- Interest payment(coupon): They pay some money to investor per year

### Present Value and Interest Rate
PV = Present Value
R = Interest payment from bond per year
i = interest rate
$$PV = \frac{R}{1+i}$$
Generally over multiple years
$$PV = \Sigma\frac{Rt}{(1+i)^t}$$
*Ceteris paribus*, the PV is negatively related to the interest rate and positively related to R, the payment.

### PV and Market Price of Bond
$$P_B = PV = \Sigma\frac{Rt}{(1+i)^t}$$
Market price should equal PV
Interest and Bond yield move together
- $P_B \text{ rises, interest } i \text{ falls}$
- $P_B \text{ falls, interest } i \text{ rises}$

## Reasons to hold money
1. Transactions motive: Use money normally
3. Precautionary motive: Need money in case emergency
4. Speculative motive: Hold money in case good investment shows up


Determinant of money demand
real GDP, price level, interest rate = $M_D (i,P,Y)$


Excess supply money, more people buy bonds, $B_P$ falls make interest up
Excess demand money, more people sell bonds, $B_P$ rise make interest down

### Monetary Transmission Mechanism
1. Increase in Money Supply $M_s$
2. Change in desired investment
	1. shift in AE function
	2. shift in AD curve
3. 2nd round feedback
	1. Reduced effect on AD curve


Bank increases money supply $\rightarrow$ interest rate fall $\rightarrow$ $ depreciate $\rightarrow$ increase exports
this shift AE up and AD right
