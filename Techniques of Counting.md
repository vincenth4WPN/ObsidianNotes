## Techniques of Counting (Chapter 5 of DM)

### Permutations
- Counting where ORDER MATTERS

P(n) = n!

#### Permutation of a Subset
- Ways to select 2 balls from 5 balls
	- 5!/3! = 5x4
- Notation:
$$P(n,k) = \frac {n!}{n-k} $$


#### Permutations with Repetition
- Notation:
$$P(n) = \frac {n!}{n_1!n_2!n_3!}$$

### Combinations
Counting where order does not matter

$$\frac {n!}{k!(n-k)!}$$
